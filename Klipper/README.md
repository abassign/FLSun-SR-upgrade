Why use Klipper

A review project of the SR functionality requires both a mechanical approach, to be performed mainly with 3D prints, and a software approach that exploits the features of Klipper, which is absolutely the most suitable environment to be able to correctly program the functionality.

I hope this chapter can also be useful for other creations and other projects, as it wants to analyze many aspects of Klipper and its interfacing with the devices present in a wired 3D printer.

A part of the documents will be in Italian to meet the needs of the readers of the FLSun-Italia forum who follow this GIT, but I will provide some translations into English to help other makers who want to exploit the information and links I make available.
All documents in Italian will have the postfix "IT" added in the name, those in English the postfix "EN".
