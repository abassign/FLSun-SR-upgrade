This effector version, has been tested on my SR since October 2022, Compared to the effector that comes standard with the printer, this effector has several advantages:

It is 30% lighter than the aluminum effector
Its rigidity is high, but only if suitable materials are used, this aspect must absolutely be taken into account, even the same material with a different color has a different rigidity due to the fact that the color of the plastics, in filament printers, also gives the cooling time, and thus affect the crystallization of thick plastic. For this reason I advise against using different materials, unless one's own experience suggests even better solutions.
The material of the effector must be such as to allow an easy construction of the threads, there are several, it is a wrong construction of the thread, it brings a high difficulty in copying the various parts.
There is a need to use both M4 and M3 type screws, the screws have different lengths depending on their positioning. The screws must absolutely be made of nylon as, on the threads obtained through the classic mechanical techniques, a metallic material would rapidly damage the thread which is not compatible with the type of use.

The procedure for making the threads can be learned from the articles that can be found on the internet. For those on a budget, the use of grub screws works very well. With an Allen head, they are long enough, you can easily find even 30 -40mm long for M4 and 20-30mm for M3. Gran is inserted on the spindle of a screwdriver, is wetted with the WB-40 fluid and screwed slowly. With this technique you can build the threads quickly and efficiently. I advise against the use of metal inserts, as they are too heavy.

The effector is made in two parts, an outer ring, which serves to support the arms of the printer, similar to the effector supplied as standard by FLSun, for which I use the same supports spherical supports with 12 mm long shank and M3 diameter and 8mm diameter ball.
The outer ring has been constructed to be able to use it with different inner cores, thus reducing material consumption. The building density must be quite high, 30-40%, with an internal geometry of the cells that develops in 3D (Gyroid).
Once the piece has been printed, before moving on to its finishing, it is advisable to try to take it in your hands and apply a torsional effort, the correct construction if the torsion is practically zero with an effort of a few kilos.

The inner core must fit almost perfectly with the ring, for this reason the size is about 2 tenths smaller, it should fit almost all printers,
This part requires multiple places to machine with the thread, both M4 threads and M3 threads.

All the additional parts, the extruder, hot-end etc. are mounted on the internal body.

I noticed, with surprise, that the 3D printed plastic effector better absorbs the vibrations that occur in the print, as the plastic material has this ability. Therefore you will notice very smooth prints especially at the corners.

The printing material used for my test printing of these important parts is: ColorFabb_HT black (copolyester).
It is also possible to use PETG, it is very stiff and light, it should produce even lighter parts and therefore further improve performance, but it has a defect, it cannot exceed 60 Â°C in temperature! Above this temperature it will tend to lose its rigidity. If the use of the printer does not plan to print materials at high temperatures, it can be an excellent choice.
